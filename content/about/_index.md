## Bio

My name is Loránd Fazakas. I graduated as a Computer Scientist from Eötvös Loránd University in 2018. 

I've done my summer internship at Hortonworks in Budapest and later I've became a Java mentor at Progmatic Academy. During that time I was really into Java, Spring and Spring Boot. My graduation work was a Library Management web and android application (native). The backend was using Spring Boot (Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Core) and Java, while the frontend was generated by Thymeleaf.

After graduation I've started working as an automation engineer at Asseco Central Europe Hungary. My first big project there was to build the test automation infrastructure from scratch for the business unit. Then I started automate things like deployment and test execution thats when I've got interested in DevOps. I've used technologies like Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Robot Framework, Selenium, Jmeter, Zephyr for Jira. The main programming language I use at my current workplace is Python, Bash and occasionally Java.
